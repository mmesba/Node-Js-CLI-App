<!-- The Problems and The Solutions -->
## The problems and The Solutions
<h3>This app is basically formed on event based architecture. An event emits on a particular command and listeners listen based on that event. I used 'readline' module to receive input from users. Also used 'os' and 'v8' module to get very low level statistics in operating system like 'Malloced memory', 'heap' , 'uptime' and many more. Every module used in this app is native in node, no external module is used here. Event there is no package.json file included here because there is no external package here to maintain.</h3>
